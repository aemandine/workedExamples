  There are many ways to find the area of a triangle. Using Heron's Formula, one can find the area using A = sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-b)), where <i>s</i> represents the semiperimeter of the triangle, or half the perimeter. If two
  sides (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) and the angle between them (<i>C</i>) are given, the area can be found using the formula 1/2 * <i>a</i> * <i>b</i> * sin(<i>C</i>). There are many ways to calculate information about a triangle, but
  sometimes it requires quite a bit of busywork. Why don't we write our own program to do all the work for us?
 </p>

<p> Write a program that allows the reader to choose between two options: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Starting with the length of all three sides</li>
  <li>Starting with the length of two sides and the angle between them</li>
</ul>
<p>Prompt the user for the information they have (either all three sides or two sides and an angle) and then calculate and output the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Length of all sides</li>
  <li>Perimeter</li>
  <li>Area</li>
</ul>
<p>Your output for option (1) should look like this:</p>

<p>You'll need to add this line to the top of your file to access the <code>math.sin()</code>, <code>math.cos()</code>, and <code>math.sqrt()</code> functions, and the <code>math.pi</code> constant: <b><code> import math </code></b> </p>

<p> Note that <code>math.sin()</code> and <code>math.cos()</code> accept angles in terms of radians, so you'll need to convert from radians to degrees.</p>
<p> You can assume that the user will always type correct input. They will correctly type a 1 or a 2 to answer the first question, and they will not input the side lengths of an impossible triangle.</p>
